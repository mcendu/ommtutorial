# McEndu's VSRG level creation tutorial

You played a lot of VSRG levels. You feel satisfied every time you play
a level, and you are tempted to create levels of your own. Or you are
impressed by the plays of good players, and want to make something to
challenge them. Or you have been introduced to level making by a level
maker somewhere in your community.

No matter how you got interest in VSRG level making, welcome here! This
is a tutorial on VSRG level making, made to answer your questions on
how to start. Hopefully.

Most illustrations are in osu!mania 7K; However, most of the concepts
are key-count agnostic, and applies well to other VSRGs, like 4K.

# What is VSRG level creation?

So you might ask, &ldquo;What is VSRG level creation?&rdquo;

**VSRG** is &ndash; obviously &ndash; an abbreviation. The full name is
**vertical scrolling rhythm game**. This implies that it is a subgenre
of rhythm game.

**Rhythm game** is a genre of music-themed video game that challenges
a player's sense of rhythm.\[[1]\] In a rhythm game, a player presses
buttons in a sequence specified on screen, which in turn matches the
rhythm of a specific track of music being played. The term
&ldquo;VSRG&rdquo; refers to a specific type of rhythm game, in which
action indicators, often called **notes**, fall downwards, upwards,
or toward the player, eventually passing over a **receptor** taking the
form of a stationary note-like objects or a line. When a note overlaps
with the receptor, the player must perform a specific action dictated
by the note. A judgement is then given for the action, or the lack of
one; The closer the note is to the receptor, a better judgement or a
higher score is given.

A **level**, also known as a **beatmap** or a **chart** depending on
community, consists of multiple notes in a specific sequence. The
player is tasked with playing a level of their choice to the end. When
the player played to the end, a score is given; the better the player
tried to hit every note right when they arrived at the receptor, the
better the player would score.

But how is a level made? In a rhythm game, a piece of music accompanies
every level. And here comes the characteristic of a rhythm game: In a
good level, every note is related to the accompanying music. Often, a
perfect judgement on a note happens exactly at the playing of a sound
in the music. Random notes unrelated to the music is no fun to play.

Confused? In the next chapter, you would know what a sound in a music
is.
